La Belle Verte (The Green Beautiful) is a French film written, directed by and starring Coline Serreau.
In the years following its release, it was mysteriously banned throughout much of Europe and Russia.
It is a VERY difficult movie to get a hold of, particularly with the poor English translations.
This said, it is one of the most amazing and truly beautiful and heart-warming films I have ever seen.
It is a story about self-realization and harmony, a message of peace and makes you rethink the way you live your life.
